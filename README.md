I started my journey of becoming a DevOps engineer.First of all, I decided to take LabEx, which will teach me the basics of Linux.

I have mastered the basic file operations in Linux:
Navigating the file system using "cd" and "pwd"
Creating files and directories using "touch" and "mkdir"
Viewing content using "ls" and its options
Copying files and directories using "cp"
Move and rename using "mv"
Deleting files and directories using "rm" and "rmdir"

I have mastered such commands as "head" "diff" "cat" and "tail" for different file operations
I have acquired knowledge of system administration commands such as "chown" "chmod" and the "sudo" command, which gives access to commands that require more rights

Today I learned how to create and delete users using the "useradd" and "userdel" commands, set a password with the "passwd" command, and lock and unlock it. I learned how to change the home directory, shell, add users to groups using "usermod" and various additional options.

Today I have worked out the use of several basic commands that every system administrator should be familiar with.:
whoami: to verify your user identity
uname: to verify information about the operating system and ensure compatibility.
who: to see who else is working on the development server.
id: To verify group membership and user data for proper access control.
top: for monitoring system processes and resource usage in order to ensure optimal performance.
Output redirection (> and >>): To document your results in professional reports.
