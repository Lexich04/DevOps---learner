I started my journey of becoming a DevOps engineer.First of all, I decided to take LabEx, which will teach me the basics of Linux.

I have mastered the basic file operations in Linux:
Navigating the file system using "cd" and "pwd"
Creating files and directories using "touch" and "mkdir"
Viewing content using "ls" and its options
Copying files and directories using "cp"
Move and rename using "mv"
Deleting files and directories using "rm" and "rmdir"

I have mastered such commands as "head" "diff" "cat" and "tail" for different file operations
I have acquired knowledge of system administration commands such as "chown" "chmod" and the "sudo" command, which gives access to commands that require more rights
