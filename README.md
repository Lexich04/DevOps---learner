# DevOps---learner
I started my journey of becoming a DevOps engineer.First of all, I decided to take LabEx, which will teach me the basics of Linux.

I have mastered the basic file operations in Linux:
Navigating the file system using "cd" and "pwd"
Creating files and directories using "touch" and "mkdir"
Viewing content using "ls" and its options
Copying files and directories using "cp"
Move and rename using "mv"
Deleting files and directories using "rm" and "rmdir"

I have mastered such commands as "head" "diff" "cat" and "tail" for different file operations
I have acquired knowledge of system administration commands such as "chown" "chmod" and the "sudo" command, which gives access to commands that require more rights

Today I learned how to create and delete users using the "useradd" and "userdel" commands, set a password with the "passwd" command, and lock and unlock it. I learned how to change the home directory, shell, add users to groups using "usermod" and various additional options.

Today I have worked out the use of several basic commands that every system administrator should be familiar with.:
whoami: to verify your user identity
uname: to verify information about the operating system and ensure compatibility.
who: to see who else is working on the development server.
id: To verify group membership and user data for proper access control.
top: for monitoring system processes and resource usage in order to ensure optimal performance.
Output redirection (> and >>): To document your results in professional reports.

I continued my journey by studying Git. Today I found out:
How to create a Git repository (your time machine) using the git init command
How to check the status of your repository using the git status command
How to create files and prepare them for commit using the git add command
How to create a commit (save point in time) using the git commit command
How to view the history of your project using the git log command

1.10.2025

Today I have mastered the git config command, which is the main tool for configuring repository settings. I've changed various settings: username, email, formatting, and magazine editor. And also created shortcuts (alias) for simplified navigation.

2/10/2025

Today I found out:
How to add files to staging area using "git add"
How to ignore files that you don't want to track using ".gitignore"
How to view changes in files before committing using "git diff"
How to undo the addition of changes using "git restore --staged"

7.10.2025

Today I learned how to create new branches using git branch, switch to them using git switch, merge branches using git merge, and delete them using the -d flag or force with -D

8.10.2025

Unfortunately, the free Git labs ended on that site and I had to move on to the next point, namely the basics of working with the Shell. I studied the WebIDE interface, and also created and ran my first primitive script.

In another lab job, I learned:
Creating and referencing shell variables
Using special syntax to refer to variables in various scenarios
Applying command substitution to save command output using $()
Performing arithmetic operations with shell variables using using $((expression))
Working with environment variables

9.10.2025

Today I studied:
Accessing individual arguments using special variables ($1, $2, etc.)
Using the $# variable to determine the number of arguments
Implementation of conditional logic for processing different numbers of arguments
Using the $@ variable to iterate through all passed arguments
In addition, I practiced initializing arrays, adding elements to them, accessing certain elements, and determining the number of elements in the array.
